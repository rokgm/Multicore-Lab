To compile the code run the following command:
```make all```

To run the player instance with Parallel Alpha-Beta strategy (number 5) run the following command:
``` ./player -s 5 1000 X ```
or for the opposite color:
``` ./player -s 5 1000 O ```
We set max depth to 1000, as we will limit by time and not depth.
